# Testing

There are no working tests for Clapp.

Writing a series of unit tests for Clapp functionality is an early priority.
An extant testing framework is preferrable, but only so long as it is minimally contraining.
It could provide some handrails for early development decisions, but shouldn't guide design.

After the frameworks and unit tests, a sufficient strategy may be writing reactionary tests.
